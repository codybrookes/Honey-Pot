# Honey Pot Creation

## Objective
This SSH honey pot creation was for the purpose of setting traps for attackers and to gather intelligence about their identity, methods and motivations on trying to hack into our network. The primary focus was to design a honey pot to deepen understanding of network security, attack patterns, and defensive strategies.

### Skills Learned

- Advanced understanding of setting a cyber security trap. 
- Proficiency in linux commands to create a working honeypot.
- Ability to recognize attack signatures and patterns.
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.

### Tools Used

- Cloud Computing System such as Azure to set up a virtual machine. 
- Github to find a solid honeypot the fits our needs. 
- Linux to run the docker that set up the honeypot. 

## Steps

Step 1: Set up virtual machine via cloud computing service. 

Step 2: Run Cowrie in Docker locally with creating your own image.

Step 3: Then run an SSH client to port 2222 to test it.

Step 4: Let the honeypot run and collect data for any possible attacks. 

Step 5: Testing the honey we used Nmap to see what attackers see when they are poking around.
